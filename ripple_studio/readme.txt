The font rendering on your individual systems might distort the alignment of the app elements. For example, the info box might have overshot text. If this happens, change the 'FontSize' arguments in the code to 8/9. Due to a variety of system configurations, optimising the visuals for every installation is currently out of scope. A future version may include a cross-system optimised version.

The installation package is built for 'FontSize' 9 for the Windows version. However, for a high-resolution screen, the app might appear smaller.
